# SSH login without password

To login to an HPC cluster without entering a password we will first create public and private "keys" on our **local machine**. The public key will then be appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the desired cluster. When we try to connect to that cluster if the public and private keys match then we will be granted access without needing to type our password.

## Linux and Mac

On your **local machine** (e.g., laptop), first create the RSA key pair. This is done with the following command (press the [Enter] key 3 times after running the command below, i.e., do not answer any of the questions):

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Here is an example:

```
[jdh4@notexa ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jdh4/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/jdh4/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jdh4/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:WAmli4zRUQGWhIHkT4oXi1CjwNJd3KYKNe5OK8DpcZY jdh4@notexa.princeton.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|+++==*=+.        |
|=+o+=..oo.       |
|+.o+...oo        |
|o.=*...+         |
|+.=++.o S        |
|.= E+            |
|..+o .           |
| .. o            |
|   .             |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The public key is now located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. The private key (identification) is located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Keep your private key private. Do not shared it. However, you can share your public key and we will do that next.

Copy the public key to the server's `authorized_keys` file (enter your password for the **HPC cluster** when prompted):

```
ssh-copy-id <NetID>@<hpc_cluster>.princeton.edu
```

Note that the `ssh-copy-id` command is essentially doing the following:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <NetID>@<hpc-cluster>.princeton.edu "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Here is an example session:

```
[jdh4@notexa ~]$ ssh-copy-id jdh4@tiger.princeton.edu
The authenticity of host 'tiger.princeton.edu (128.112.172.210)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Hc3x7Tfs3ULz49U2jmpxzOGNwm2p8mkUnZVs8X1X7g8.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:15:47:21:af:6c:ac:5e:e7:88:d5:de:73:d5:ea:c4:9f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Password: 
Duo two-factor login for jdh4

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Phone call to XXX-XXX-5201
 2. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-5201 (next code starts with: 2)

Passcode or option (1-2): 1

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'jdh4@tiger.princeton.edu'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

Then try to ssh to the cluster. You should no longer need to enter a password. Run the `ssh-copy-id` for each HPC cluster that you have an account on.

### Trouble with tigressdata

If the procedure above fails on tigressdata (i.e., you still have to enter your password) then ssh to tigressdata and run this command:

```
restorecon -R ~/.ssh
```

Exit from tigressdata, and the next time you connect you should not need your password.

## Windows with PowerShell

Follow [these directions](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-in-openssh-for-windows-10/) to create the keys but don't follow the "Copying the public key securely" procedure. If your public key is on your laptop in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` then the following can be used to copy it to the desired HPC cluster:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <NetID>@<HPC-Cluster>.princeton.edu "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

## Windows for PuTTY users

Install [PuTTY gen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (puttygen.exe).

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/2nkAQ9M6ZF8) but at 2:27 do not enter a passphrase and stop watching the video around 5:22.
